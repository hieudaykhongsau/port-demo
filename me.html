                <p>This is my first portfolio page, so there are still many shortcomings.
                    My name is Hiếu, and I'm currently a first-year student at FPT University, majoring in Software
                    Engineering.
                    As many people know, this field is very challenging and requires a lot of self-learning,
                    exploration,
                    and logical thinking — so almost everyone starts out on the same level.
                    I hope that one day, I’ll be able to build a complete website on my own.</p>
                <p>These are some of my hobbies:</p>
                <ul class="hobbies">
                    <li>Playing League of Legends</li>
                    <li>Playing guitar</li>
                    <li>Listening to music</li>
                    <li>Playing the football</li>
